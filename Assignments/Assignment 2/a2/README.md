# Assignment 2 Solution
Solution for both written and coding parts of Assignemnt 2. I also include my saved parameters from the 40000-th iteration.

Note that the written part explicitly states that word vectors are column vectors, whereas the programming part says that they are row vectors. Therefore, the expressions for losses and gradients may seem different in two parts but they are essentially the same.
