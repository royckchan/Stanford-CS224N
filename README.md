# Stanford-CS224N
Chris Manning's Stanford CS224N (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) course materials - http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/

I store all the course materials of Stanford CS224N for Winter 2021, which include (i) lecture notes,(ii) slides, (iii) assignments (including Python starter codes), and (iv) my own solutions to assignments (hw 1-3 done, hw4-5 finished coding part). All the programming assignments are done in Python.
